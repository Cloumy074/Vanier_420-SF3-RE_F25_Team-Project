# Changes made to the proposal
1. Added the traveling wave equation (`Acos(kx - wt + \delta)`) to the brief description of the application, and added one mathematical relationship (the one for wavelength).
2. Added a `reset` button to the sample interface
3. Modified the cover page such that course name and title starts, then follows the project name and details

# Testing:
JUnit testing was at first assigned to Yixin Liu, later unfortunately got moved to the backlog due to the work overload. 

So the JUnit testing in this project got simplified a lot, is only testing the calculation methods of frequency, wavelength, speed, and the getYPos() Methods since it's part of the core.
